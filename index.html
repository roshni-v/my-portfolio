                        Hi, my name is Roshni Vakil!    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a third year at Cal Poly SLO majoring in computer science.
    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although I did not personally begin any computer science related endeavors until 9th grade, the field has always been a part of my life. My mom is my greatest inspiration, and a computer scientist herself. So I grew up spending my free time playing around on Microsoft Paint and being told about all the viruses that I could get if I clicked on just about anything. For as long as I can remember, I have also deeply loved animated movies (hence the quotes). My dream job growing up was to be a computer animator. Ultimately, these influences are what brought me to computer science and engineering in high school. During my freshman year, I decided to take an introductory computer science course and sign up for Dublin High School’s robotics club.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My computer science class introduced me to the basics of coding and made me fluent in HTML, CSS and Python. We did numerous fascinating projects (some of which are detailed in the projects section of this portfolio). Each of them strengthened my preexisting appreciation for logic. I learned that coding is not at all as abstract or as complicated as I had believed. It was very, very fun! The flexibility of this introductory course also allowed my projects to stretch as far as my imagination would let me. As long as I fulfilled the basic criteria, I could program whatever I wanted. And I truly enjoyed having that free creative will. At the end of the school year, my efforts earned me a spot in Dublin High School’s incredible Engineering Academy under the computer science pathway.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My first year robotics experience left me feeling a bit more ambivalent. I started out as a member on the development team, but even so it was initially incredibly daunting. Unlike myself, most of my teammates had done some sort of robotics in middle school. They were significantly more knowledgeable than I was. I was also one of only five girls in the entire club of over thirty students. And to top it all off, I wasn’t even sure if I wanted to be there. I had never done anything like robotics before, and I was completely out of my comfort zone.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I didn't quit, though. My desire to learn their skills and share their experiences outweighed my insecurities. On the development team, I learned plenty of basic engineering principles, as well the importance of effective communication and teamwork. Then, in my sophomore year I moved out of the development team and into a competitive one. I found a mentor in a teammate whose patience and clarity when explaining concepts helped me understand the logic and creativity of design. Their passion for robotics ignited my own. As a junior, I was a proud member of team 5327R, where I served as both a builder and as head programmer. I also took the time after school to mentor incoming robotics club members. I sought to pay forward the aid that was provided to me in my sophomore year. Unfortunately, my senior year season was cut short due to COVID-19, but it didn’t detract from the fact that my entire robotics experience has shaped a significant portion of who I am today. It made me realize that although a situation may seem initially daunting, with practice and hard work any barrier can be overcome.                     </p>
                    <p>
                        It has also given me a deep sense of appreciation for working with difference– difference in disciplines and difference between people. This was the main reason why I was a team lead during my first year in college for an interdisciplinary project in our Society of Women Engineers club. Throughout the school year I very much enjoyed working with people of different skill sets and majors to design a single cohesive project together. This desire for diversity is also a key contributing factor as to why I am currently studying abroad this quarter in Rome, Italy. Aside from the fact that Italy is undoubtedly beautiful, I am here because I wanted to push myself outside of my comfort zone and immerse myself in an entirely new culture. Computer science is a global field. People from all walks of life build technology. For that reason and because I seek to have a broader understanding of the world than a routine life would provide, I am working on learning how to effectively engage with people who come from very different backgrounds and lifestyles than me. I firmly believe that you grow the most and make the greatest impact only when you really challenge yourself. And that is the mindset that I intend to carry with me through life.                    </p>
                    <p>
