                        Hi, my name is Roshni Vakil!    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a freshman at Cal Poly SLO majoring in computer science.

                       Although I did not personally begin any computer science or engineering related endeavors until 9th grade, the presence of these two fields in my life has been eternally palpable. I grew up in a household with both of my parents working as engineers, and for as long as I can remember, I have deeply loved animated movies. This is what ultimately brought me to computer science and engineering. During my freshman year in high school, I decided to take an introductory computer science course and sign up for Dublin High School’s robotics club.

                        My computer science class introduced me to the basics of coding and made me fluent in HTML, CSS and Python. We did numerous fascinating projects (some of which are detailed in the projects section of this portfolio). Each of them strengthened my preexisting appreciation for logic. I learned that coding is not at all as abstract or as complicated as I had believed. It was very, very fun! The flexibility of this introductory course also allowed my projects to stretch as far as my imagination would let me. A long as I fulfilled the basic criteria, I could program whatever I wanted. And I truly enjoyed having that free creative will. At the end of the school year, my efforts earned me a spot in Dublin High’s incredible Engineering Academy under the computer science pathway.

                        My first year robotics experience left me feeling a bit more ambivalent. I started out as a member on the development team, but even so it was initially incredibly daunting. Unlike myself, most of my teammates had done some sort of robotics in middle school. They were significantly more knowledgeable than I was. I was also one of only five girls in the entire club of over thirty students. And to top it all off, I wasn’t even sure if I wanted to be there. I had never done anything like this before, and I was completely out of my comfort zone.

                    <p>
                        I didn't quit, though. My desire to learn their skills and share their experiences outweighed my insecurities. On the development team, I learned plenty of basic engineering principles, as well the importance of effective communication and teamwork. Then, in my sophomore year I moved out of the development team and into a competitive one. I found a mentor in a teammate whose patience and clarity when explaining concepts helped me understand the logic and creativity of design. Their passion for robotics ignited my own. As a junior, I was a proud member of team 5327R, where I served as both a builder and as head programmer. I also took the time after school to mentor incoming robotics club members. I sought to pay forward the aid that was provided to me in my sophomore year. Unfortunately, my senior year season was cut short due to COVID-19, but it didn’t detract from the fact that my entire robotics experience has shaped a significant portion of who I am today. It made me realize that although a situation may seem initially daunting, with practice and hard work any barrier can be overcome. It has also given me a deep sense of appreciation for interdisciplinary projects. I realized that there is so much that can be achieved in the cross-sections of different disciplines.

                        Which is one of the primary reasons why--currently--I am a team lead for an interdisciplinary project in Cal Poly’s Society of Women Engineers with our industry sponsor, Mazzetti. I’m excited about the prospect of working with people with different skill sets to design a single cohesive project together. I strive to learn by doing (our school’s motto). My experiences have taught me that you grow the most and make the greatest impact only when you really challenge yourself. And that is the mindset that I intend to carry with me through life.
