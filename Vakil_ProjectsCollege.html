                    The objective of this Fundamentals of Computer Science project was to write a program that would be able to take in a file with a 100-character string in its first line, convert that into a 10x10 puzzle, then take a string of words from the second line and check to see if the words are all in the puzzle (and where, if they are). Further instructional details can be found <a href='Image/Project3-WordFinder.pdf' id='underline' target="_blank">here</a>. We were provided several files containing these two input strings for testing purposes. As instructed, I began by first dividing the program’s tasks among several different functions and writing out pseudocode for each of them. I decided that one would create the puzzle from the first string, another would create a list of search words from the second string, and several others would check for words in each of the required directions (forward, up, down, diagonal). This pseudocode can be found in <a href='https://github.com/roshni-v/cpe101-word-finder-project' id='underline' target="_blank">my final program</a> below each fully fleshed out function. Once I completed this, I began working on implementation. I created a Point class that would hold an x and y coordinate (called row and column, respectively) for a character in a puzzle. I also implemented the repr function so that when the program displayed the location of the first character of a word in a puzzle, it returned a meaningful string and not a meaningless Point object. After this, I implemented each of the functions described prior. Once I created the function that checked for words in the forward direction, I called it in each of the other directions’ search functions. The only change I made was in flipping the puzzle accordingly each time. So for the downwards function, for example, I just switched the row and column values of each character in the puzzle, and then inputted that new puzzle into the forwards function. If the function found any of the desired words, it meant that the words were actually spelled downwards). Upon completing all of these functions, I imported them to a different Python file (a main file, essentially), where I called them all in a logical manner for the full program to function as required. I earned an A on this project.                </p>

                     For this final CPE 123 project, we were assigned to collaborate in a group of four to create a short animated scene, a small game, or some sort of interactive sketch (details about the project requirements can be found <a href= "Image/final_project_instructions.pdf" id="underline" target="_blank">here</a>). My group decided to create a game together. I came up with the basic concept of the game early on: a car racing game in which the cars are propelled forward by repeatedly pressing a certain key. It was based on my very first ever coding project (which can be found at the bottom of my high school projects section): a snail race game. My groupmates bought into the concept and added on their own requirements for the game. We decided that a main menu would display first, allowing the user to select from an array of cars. Then the race would take place. Turbos for the cars would be included. I led our meetings by setting up times and dates for Zoom calls outside of class, and then making sure we stayed on task and addressed pending issues methodically during these meetings. I delegated tasks so that everyone had something to work on each week before we came back to report the next meeting. The parts of the game that I was in charge of were: tying the movement of the cars to certain keys, varying the speeds and turbo frequencies of the different cars, programming in the speed reduction if the turbos were pressed out of time, and designing the side profiles of each car in the selection menu. The code for the finished game can be found <a href= "https://github.com/roshni-v/cpe123-projects-labs/blob/main/finalproject.js" id="underline" target="_blank">here</a>. Our professor commented that our project had nice physics and detail. Our thorough work earned us 104%.

                     The objective of this CPE 123 project was to primitively animate a hierarchically modeled character that we either designed ourselves or completed given the professor’s starter code. The instructions can be found <a href= "Image/lab6_instructions.pdf" id="underline" target="_blank">here</a>. I chose to create my own creature—a frog that would jump up and down. To begin, I created the body of the frog and then progressively built the limbs onto it. Then, I employed some trigonometry to calculate how the angles of the quads and calves segments needed to increase or decrease with the rising and falling of the frog’s body to convincingly simulate jumping. Explanations of my mathematical calculations can be found <a href= "Image/frog_leg_calculations.pdf" id="underline" target="_blank">here</a>. After the full motion was established, I incorporated a clickable region to be able to start and stop the clock controlling the jumping motion whenever the user desires. Finally, I worked in the background to make the whole animation more cohesive. <a href= "https://github.com/roshni-v/cpe123-projects-labs/blob/main/lab6.js" id="underline" target="_blank">This</a> was my final code. For going above and beyond, I earned a 104% on this lab.
