                    The objective of this DE project was to design, simulate, and breadboard a control system with six inputs and a clear purpose that used AOI logic. The <a href='Image/Copy of P2_1_6_AOI_CircuitDesign.pdf' id='underline' target="_blank">instructions</a> and <a href='Image/Copy of P2_1_6_AOI_CircuitDesign_Rubric.pdf' id='underline' target="_blank">rubric</a> further detail all of these requirements. The control system that my partner and I came up with was a “smart” heating device that determined whether or not a building’s heater should be activated given six different inputs: whether someone was at home, whether the temperature was below seventy degrees in the building, whether the current time was in the peak energy time (the time frame when electricity is the most pricey, set by energy distributer companies), whether a window and/or door was open, whether the humidity was below 50% in the building, and whether a person in the establishment had manually turned on the heater. After creating these variables, my partner and I went through each possibility in the <a href='Image/P216_Fannin_VakilTruth Table.pdf' id='underline' target="_blank">truth table</a> together and determined which combinations should cause the heater to turn on. Then, individually, we simplified the function and checked with each other to ensure that our work was correct. After this, I created the multisim simulation for our circuit while my partner breadboarded the device. Through the course of the project we regularly updated our <a href='Image/P216_Fannin_Vakil.pdf' id='underline' target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href='Image/Copy of P216_Fannin_Vakil_GanttChart&ProjectLogs.pdf' id='underline' target="_blank">project logs</a>. Our device and simulation were functional and our documentation was thorough, earning us an A on this project.

                    In this first DE project of the year, I was tasked to first find a circuit online to perform a 
                     function of my choice, then breadboard it to prove that it worked as advertised, and finally create a PCB with 
                     soldered components for it. The <a href="Image/Copy of P1_2_7_PCB_Design.pdf" id='underline' target="_blank">instructions</a> and <a href= "Image/Copy of P1_2_7_PCB_Design_Rubric.pdf" id='underline' target="_blank">rubric</a> provided detailed all of these requirements. I opted 
                     to work with a <a href="Image/Instructables.com - USB tester.pdf" id='underline' target="_blank">USB port tester</a> circuit that I found on Instructables. To summarize, the circuit had two LEDs 
                     and plugged into a USB port. If the USB port’s polarity was correct, the green LED would light up. If the polarity
                     was reversed (an error that some computers have that can irreplaceably damage USBs), the red LED would light up. And 
                     if no power is received from the USB port, neither LED glows. After breadboarding, I used the software Fritzing 
                     to create my PCB layout. I printed the layout out and ironed it onto a copper plate. I then let it soak in a 
                     ferric chloride bath to react all of the copper except the traces under the ink. Afterwards, I scraped off the 
                     ink to expose the copper and drilled holes for my components. The final step was to solder these components on.
                     My printed circuit board functioned as intended. This project was really creatively engaging, and now I have my
                     own personally made USB port tester! I wrote up <a href="Image/P1_2_7_Vakil.pdf" id='underline' target="_blank">documentation</a> detailing my work.

                    The goal of this project was to creatively alter the program for a virtual card game called elevens that we were guided through coding in class. In this elevens card game, two virtual cards can only be cleared if they are the only cards selected and their sum is eleven. From this, I chose to create a game called Clear the Board. This game is quite like memory game except it is Single Player, you can flip over as many cards as you want at a time (but you can only remove cards from the board if you close all other cards except for the pair that you want to clear), and there is no winner. The goal, instead, is to clear the board in the fastest amount of time. My development process for <a href= "https://github.com/roshni-v/doublesCardGame" id='underline' target="_blank">this program</a> was three-fold. First, in the ElevensBoard class, I changed the program to recognize pairs of the same point value instead of pairs that add up to eleven. Second, I called only clubs and diamonds onto the board in the Deck class so that there are only two cards with the same point value and not four. I also added two jokers. Finally, I altered the CardGameGUI. The majority of my time working on the project was spent here. I changed the logic for the display and removal of cards and added a timer. My main challenges were understanding the provided starter code, figuring out how to be able to open and close the cards and clear them if a double arised, and adding a timer. Potential future improvements include setting the program up so that you can only open two cards at a time and making the code itself more concise.

                    The task assigned to my entire AP CSA class was for each student to create a class named after themselves in Greenfoot, an integrated development environment using Java. This class was to be derived from an abstract student class provided to us, and was to use a static classroom instance to do the following: encompass each student instance and visually display their distinct location in the classroom. The location was based on our actual seating arrangements in class. My RoshniVakil class had an image of myself, an audio recording of me saying my name, and an action method that I constructed called circleClass(). When my image in the classroom was clicked, my audio recording would play and my circleClass() method would cause my image to spin. I worked through this project by first understanding what was provided to me. Then I began to piece together my RoshniVakil class by recording my name pronunciation file and downloading a photo of myself. The most challenging part of this project was programming the circleClass() method. It was where we were given complete creative will to have our photos do anything in the span of roughly ten seconds. I chose to have my image spin, turn into a capital R, and then reorient itself upright before returning to the photo of my face. It took several iterations to perfect the entire sequence.

                    The task assigned to my partner and me for this project was to design a bridge using Bridge Designer 
                    Software. It had to be able to support the weight of one truck while being as stable as possible and 
                    staying within the $300,000 budget. First, we created a <a href= "Image/Gantt Chart - Sheet1.pdf" id='underline' target="_blank">Gantt Chart</a> to plan out what we needed to work on each day to complete the project in time. Then, we brainstormed two designs each. I did some research, and based 
                    my two designs on the Warren Truss and the Fink Truss. After, my partner and I compared designs and graded
                    them on a scale of 1 to 10 for each of the following five categories: simplicity, stability, cost, 
                    aesthetics. My first design, based on the Warren truss received the most points on this scale. It was the
                    most stable, simplistic design, and it stayed within the price range stated in the <a href= "Image/Copy of P2_3_2WPBDesignRubric(POE).pdf" id='underline' target="_blank">rubric</a>. We selected 
                    this design to focus our future renovations on. I then made all of the modifications. After further 
                    experimentation, I realized that carbon steel was more cost effective than quenched and tempered steel. I changed my bridge so that it 
                    was solely composed of carbon steel. Then I increased the height of the bridge to reduce both the tension
                    and compression that each of the beams were under. Finally, I gathered from my research that hollow beams
                    were cheaper but better at dealing with tension than solid beams. So, I replaced all the internal members
                    of our bridge where the tension was the greatest, with thicker and hollower beams.  Beams in the final 
                    design felt practically no compression and tension. After I finalized this design, I began to aid my 
                    partner with the <a href="Image/P2.3.2_Krishna_Vakil.pdf" id='underline' target="_blank">documentation</a>. My role was to explain both of my original brainstorm designs, detail 
                    the modifications I made to the winning design, and explain the final design in the Bridge Design 
                    Justification section. Our hard efforts earned us an A on this project.

                <p>
                    In this first POE project of the year, my partners and I were assigned the task of 
                    designing and prototyping a machine using VEX robotics parts that performed a single, 
                    everyday task given one input source of human energy. This device had to contain at 
                    least four different simple machines within it. Based on the instructions and <a href='Image/P1_1_6CompoundMachineDesignRubric.pdf' id='underline' target="_blank">rubric</a>, 
                    we came up with the idea of our machine functioning to pull zippers. The model zipper 
                    would be one of our backpack zippers. Each group member then drew out two brainstorm 
                    sketches for our device. The next day we came together and decided upon which design 
                    we liked the best. I was elected project manager for this assignment because I was the
                    only one in my group with VEX experience, having been in robotics since the beginning 
                    of ninth grade. My main role on this team was as a builder. As project manager, one of
                    my most critical tasks was to be supportive and patiently introduce various parts and 
                    their functions to my team members. I taught them basic names and how to use allen 
                    wrenches and crescent wrenches when screwing parts together. It was critical to me 
                    that they both understood how to build and felt like they were fairly contributing. 
                    After deciding upon our design, I split the machine up into three separate parts: the 
                    lever, the gear train, and the two pulleys. Given that we were a group of three, I 
                    assigned each task to one person. My task was to build the gear train. To keep up with
                    the <a href='Image/Project 1_1_6 Gantt Chart - Sheet1.pdf' id='underline' target="_blank">Gantt chart</a>, we began connecting our parts after two days of individual building. 
                    After this was done, I ran several tests on our machine and made modifications to our 
                    design based on the results of my testing. For instance, since we had no hand crank, I
                    came up with the idea of using a wheel instead (like a steering wheel) to replace it. 
                    After the prototype was complete, I was then in charge of taking measurements on our 
                    machine for IMA calculations. While I was doing this, my partners did a considerable 
                    bit of work on the documentation. We each then did the IMA calculations separately and
                    before checking with each other to ensure that our work was error-free. After that, I 
                    contributed to the <a href='Image/P_1_1_6_Vakil_Wang_Yu.pdf' id='underline' target="_blank">online documentation</a> by writing the final design description, 
                    having had the most in-depth knowledge of our machine. We then <a href='Image/Team Zip-It Presentation.pdf' id='underline' target="_blank">presented</a> our prototype
                    to the class.

                    For the Hangman Project, my partner and I were given a set of 
                    <a href='Image/Hangman_Mini-Project(CSE).pdf' 
                    id='underline' target="_blank">directions</a> which instructed us to model a Hangman Game in Python. To begin the project,
                    we created a basic function that took a secret message and set of letters and checked to see whether or 
                    not the letters occurred in the secret message. If so, the letters were returned in a set of dashes and 
                    spaces, where the dashes represented the unguessed letters in the secret message. This simple function then
                    became the basis of our final game, which was the most challenging transition to make. My partner and I had
                    to take it step by step and code one feature at a time, for our end product would have been much more 
                    difficult to create if we had attempted to program it all at once. Our final game randomly chooses a secret
                    message from a list of messages. Then it displays a series of dashes, spaces, and punctuation to the user 
                    (representing the message). The user is then provided fifteen guesses. At any point in the game, they can 
                    choose to guess the entire phrase; else they can go letter by letter. Whether or not they succeed, a play 
                    again option is provided at the end. Our project earned full points for this assignment because it worked 
                    in all situations, had concise and effective code, and accurately represented an actual Hangman game. I 
                    also learned how to make ASCII art and incorporated it into our project, going above and beyond the 
                    criteria.

                    For my very first ever coding project, my partner and I were given the task of creating a fully functioning game or story using
                    Scratch. From the <a href="Image/Scratch_Game_Or_Story(CSE).pdf" id="underline" target="_blank">
                    instructions and rubric</a> provided we decided to create a snail race game based off of the Spongebob 
                    episode, The Great Snail Race. After deciding our plot, we started coding. Our work method was to allow 
                    one partner to code while the other watched and provided suggestions. After about fifteen minutes, we 
                    would switch roles. This method of teamwork was especially effective because it allowed both partners to 
                    have an equal time coding and because only by working together were we able to accomplish 
                    <a href='Image/Scratch_Project_Design_Notebook-Roshni_Vakil.pdf'
                    id='underline' target="_blank">what we did</a>. For initially, I had found Scratch to be rather confusing, but after some 
                    help from my partner and practice at home, I was able to get a better understanding of how coding worked. 
                    With that knowledge we made great progress on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/121105444/#editor" 
                    id="underline" target="_blank">our program</a> together. In the end, our game featured three players with whom you can 
                    play against (each with varying degrees of difficulty). In addition, there is a "You Win" and "You Lose" 
                    screen, and a "Play Again" option. These features were accomplished by creating sprites for the three 
                    computer-operated opponents and coding them to race under certain conditions. The game might be somewhat 
                    glitchy, for it is our first project, but it gave us a valuable introduction to the logic of coding. My 
                    partner and I each brought our own skills to the table, which combined helped make this game the best that 
                    it could be given our skill level.
