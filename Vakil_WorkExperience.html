                    Although I have not had any official work experience as of yet, my mentor, Howard Hirano, has done a great deal to increase my exposure to various engineering disciplines. Howard is a retired engineer from Sandia National Laboratories. He introduced me to several of his previous coworkers at Lawrence Livermore and Sandia Laboratories. This not only helped me see that countless jobs exist in intersection with the field of engineering, it also helped push me out of my comfort zone and grow more comfortable communicating professionally with people. Howard also provided me with valuable insights on how to approach interview situations. He showed me that during an interview the candidate is there to assess if the job is right for them just as much as the company is there to determine whether they are a right fit for the group. The interviewers should not be the only ones collecting data from the interaction. An interviewee should always prepare beforehand with notes and questions to maximize what they get out of an interview. Ultimately, Howard gave me numerous tips like these and showed me how to holistically examine my life and the career path that I am shaping for myself. It is a practice that I am very grateful to have learnt, and one that I have now come to use almost subliminally.

                   In addition, as a Dublin High School student I had the opportunity to go on many field trips to technical companies. These trips helped me internalize the diversity of engineering careers offered and got me thinking about what I may want to pursue in the future. One of my field trips as an engineering student was the Patriot Jet Team trip during my sophomore year. This field trip was incredibly memorable because of the fascinating facts that they provided to us, and the engaging demonstrations that they utilized to help us understand concepts. I never knew before that some airplanes could break the sound barrier, going over 760 miles per hour. To go faster than sound seemed crazy to me. When someone speaks, you can hear them practically instantaneously. Yet airplanes can go faster than that. In addition, another fact that in the moment seemed to simultaneously contradict what I have been taught, and yet make complete sense, was that airplanes have redundant features. At first this seemed like a joke. In Computer Science/Software Engineering it was drilled into me that redundancies in code are bad. You want your code to be concise. Yet if you think about it logically, airplanes must be redundant. They need to have backup plans because if anything goes wrong it can be life-threateningly dangerous. There must be a fail-safe option. In addition, two things that I had never thought about before, but made complete sense once told to me, were that airplanes move faster when their external gasoline tanks are pulled in and that aircrafts take off against the wind. I was able to tie these concepts back to everyday occurrences. Having figure skated before, it makes sense that the airplane moves faster once the gasoline tanks are pulled in because I spin faster when I pull in my arms. My arms, just like the gasoline tanks, are generally farther from my body to provide stability. In addition, kites take off into the wind. The same aerodynamic principle must also apply to airplanes, as they both fly. Another field trip I participated in was at Roche Molecular in my senior year. Here, I learned how intricate the devices that diagnose diseases are. They require the merging of skill sets from a wide variety of engineering disciplines to be designed and created. This intrigued me, because I hope to work in an interdisciplinary field in the future. Technology is only as meaningful as its real world application, and I aspire to use my skills to positively benefit this world--as the scientists and engineers developing a COVID-19 test at Roche Molecular clearly are.

                    Finally, guest speakers were also key in shaping my ideas about the real-world impact and use of engineering. From the several guest speakers that I had listened to as a high school engineering student, I found nuclear engineer Maynard Holliday’s presentation to be one of the most fascinating. I had not known much about the Chernobyl or Fukushima nuclear accidents before his talk. It is shocking to me that the ultra concentrated radiation from the power plants are still potent enough to render robots ineffective. Robots are usually sent on dangerous missions because they cannot die like people do. Yet even robots fail in such toxic environments. It makes you wonder how they are managing to contain such toxins, and what would have happened if the situations had not been so quickly and professionally taken care of. Hearing his stories gave me a sense of immense respect for the job and science. I was also left in awe of speaker Jason Yosinski’s work in artificial intelligence. The neural networks that he demonstrated for us were fascinating to me because of how little people understand them--including himself. Given that AI will likely become more integrated in our society as time progresses, I am glad to have received a little insight into its development. Ultimately both of these speakers provided experiences to me that were very eye-opening.
