                    The purpose of <a href="https://github.com/roshni-v/VanguardETFWebScrapeProject" id='underline' target="_blank">this project</a> was primarily to do some self-studying on web scraping. I've heard a lot about the topic and I wanted to try my hand at it and maybe glean some useful information in the process. So I chose to develop a program capable of collecting and analyzing data about all the ETFs that Vanguard offers. I began by researching the ETF listings and planning the data collection process, identifying which specific pieces of data that I wanted to analyze (number of stocks, ETF performance in the last x years, etc). Then, I looked into the Python library BeautifulSoup, which we had touched upon in my Data Science class for website data extraction. However, it quickly became clear that because Vanguard's ETF pages did not store information in pure HTML, I would not be able to access the data I wanted using solely BeautifulSoup. So I incorporated Selenium WebDriver and used the xpath of each specific data element to extract the information that I wanted. After collecting the data, my program saved the extracted information into a <a href="etfs.csv" id='underline' target="_blank" download>CSV file (download link)</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                     From here, it was classic Pandas data analysis. In a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BmOB1y_k-gniVLlXwrf7uuw8OzfRMHOS?usp=sharing" id='underline' target="_blank">Google Collab notebook</a>, I imported my CSV file into a DataFrame for better visualization. Then, I filtered out entries based on my personal criteria (detailed explanations of my filtering decisions can be found in the Collab Notebook). In the end, I compiled a shortlist of the ETFs that fulfilled my requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                     If I was going to further fine-tune the project, I would conduct more research on methods to expedite the data collection process. As it stands, the program takes several minutes to run, and this is even after I incorporated the 'headless' option for Firefox Selenium WebDriver and tried to cut down static wait times for page loading by using exception handling instead.
